# SearchOfAnomaliesWithAE
This repository includes anomaly detection research with different autoencoders

This study shows the applicability of autoencoders to find anomalies in computer networks. This study is divided into 4 parts.
1. Data import
2. Data processing
3. Implementation of autoencoder algorithms
4. Implementation of machine learning algorithms

Based on the results obtained, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the applicability of autoencoders in the search for anomalies in comparison with machine learning algorithms.
